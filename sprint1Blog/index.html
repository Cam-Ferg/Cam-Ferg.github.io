    <div class="heading-1">First Cam Thought</div>
    <div class ="paragraph-1">Hoo boy, I hate this.  Coming into coding I did not think I would need to actually talk about myself.  To kick this off with an introduction, I’m Cam Ferguson, and there’s probably a good template to follow on how to do these but it’s my self-introduction baby, so I’ll do it a little informally.  I have always felt uncomfortable when it came to expressing our feelings and personality’s, long ago I was told to write a poem about how I was feeling at that moment, so I wrote an excellent poem about how I did not want to write a poem, and honestly, it was moving and it bloody rhymed.  It’s so much easier to be self deprecating then it is to honestly talk about the things you are proud of about yourself and achievements, I feel as though if I were to compliment myself it would come across as bragging, which for some reason I am terrified of someone reading what I have written and think for a moment that I was bragging.  Also whoever put in the course, that I would need to ask other people in my life to review me, you are a sick person.  I was so uncomfortable asking them to tell me what they thought of me for this, I’m worried that they think that I’m just fishing for compliments, which I wouldn’t do.  Then I have to think of which values I personally place above all others and exemplify me, does nervousness count, what constitutes a value?  And does this blog entry matter all that much in the end, will professors look at this and just blatantly tell me I’m not cut out for coding because I’m writing this intro wrong.  I didn’t think I would become a programmer a while ago, I came into this course with almost zero computer knowledge, so It’s been quite the struggle so far but that’s why I’m doing this course in the first place, I want a new skill, and to make a change in my life.  So I’ll do my best to provide some achievements and things I’m proud of while trying to avoid having a panic attack.  </div>
    <div class="heading-2">Leadership</div>
    <div class="paragraph-2">
        Surprise surprise, nervous I may be about expressing my feelings and patting myself on the back, I’ve always seemed to gravitate towards leadership positions.  I mean when it comes to creative things of course, I probably would not do a great job of leading people in a coding team, but I enjoy motivating others through positivity, humor and energy.  In high school I was an arts leader for Drama, I was put in charge of the Theatre Sports/Improv team (one of the most fun years of my life), I was a director for the Shakespeare competition, I lead every group and presentation I was a part of in school.  In university when I studied arts, I was a part of a class of highly unmotivated people, it was frustrating when I wanted to nail every line and everyone else wanted to do was get high.  This caused our lecturer to give up essentially, but I was too excited about the potential of the show we could put on so I led the classes in his place.  It was like sprinting through mud, but baby we put on a great show about WW1 and people were shook.  Before I came to this course, I was a bartender as well, I’ve worked at several places and was training to pick up my managers license, because from all those places I worked, all I could see were things that could be improved, areas that could be more efficient, and better ways to motivate people and make them enjoy working.  I became very frustrated with people who were above me who seemed to not know what they were doing; it’s a quite ugly thought am I’m not very proud of it but at my last job I often thought about how I would run things differently if roles were reversed.  Even in my social life, I don’t think I need to be too embarrassed to admit that I’m a huge nerd as well, I play dungeons and dragons very regularly, and honestly one of the things I am most proud of is running those games, I act as the dungeon master, and creating a story where everyone can enjoy themselves inside of, and being able to take a step back and say confidently that my group is enjoying something I created fills me with pride.  I wonder if Coding is similar, if I were to create a website that everyone could love and enjoy, or a game, or something artistic, if I could be part of a team that I could enjoy being a part of.  If I could come into my job with coffees for my team, so we could sit together, chat about our lives before jumping into business, I see that being a satisfying time.  I have mediated conflicts and I see the value of making sure everyone in the group is heard and respected, someone who’s unhappy is simply unproductive.

    <div class="paragraph-3">
        The instructions asked to describe my skills, but I’m not entirely how I’d describe a skill, introspection is not one of my skills.  I suppose in school I was great at drama, and was good at painting, English and math.  I worry at a certain point this is going to start sounding like a C.V.  I suppose I can use this area to talk about things I am bad at as well, because who puts their Anti-Skills on a C.V.  I’ve always had a problem with emotion, not being sure what to feel or how to feel it or being able to recognize emotion in others.  I was autistic when I was younger but have gone through quite a bit of counselling and therapy as a child, so I don’t seem very much like I was, yet some of those traits are still prevalent in my behavior today.  But I think in a weird way growing up like that is one of my skills, because let’s be honest, autism is not a disability, it’s simply another alternative way of thinking that “normal” people cannot see as easily.  It comes with alternative problem-solving methods and ways of retaining information which I think is quite geared towards programming.  It put me into the habit of being quite direct, favoring to ask people exactly what they mean and are thinking without relying on subtext, which can be a little annoying to some, but I feel just makes things quicker and easier.  Also as a child I had the perspective as an outsider, and never fit into any group, these days its easier for me, but it taught me the value of complete inclusion, and making sure everyone is taken care of.

    <div class="paragraph-4">: When it comes to my limitations, I have said this plenty of times in my reflections, but my biggest limitation in terms of coding is my lack of knowledge and experience with computers in general.  It definitely slows me down when the tutorials ask me to open three different kinds of files and I stare at the screen for an hour.  But this is one of those problems that is fixed with time and experience, I plan to overcome this obstacle.  My other limitation is time management, it’s certainly been a big problem at school, getting past distractions and not leaving everything last minute, but the suggestion of time boxing and the tips to break my habits seem very useful.  </div>
    <div class="paragraph-5"> : “describe an ethical situation and how you solved it & how has your culture influenced your values and identity” I very much dislike these questions and have been sitting here for quite some time trying to figure out how to answer them.  First, describe an ethical situation I had to overcome, most situations that I remember clearly as being huge challenging issues for me, are all very personal, and frankly private.  I cannot think of an ethical decision that is minor enough to be fine to post on a blog, but major enough to be worth mentioning.  The examples I can think of are all deeply painful to people close to me, so I won’t be sharing them.  And second, how has my culture influenced my identity?  I’m just a boring straight white atheist, my “culture” has certainly made my life easier by giving me general advantages in society based on the color of my skin and my gender, which is completely unfair and terrible.  I’ve never had to feel guilty or ashamed about anything.  Which is why respect is so important, in the regard of culture, my life has been so easy, when for others it’s a nightmare.  I have trouble answering this question, I’ve been asked many times throughout my life, and I still don’t have an answer except life put me in the fast lane though I’ve done nothing to deserve my privileges.  Yes, culture is a wonderful thing that should always be celebrated and never forgotten, but my culture is just my immediate family, and a general lack of fear of life after death.  If I’m answering this question wrong so be it, that’s what I got.</div>
