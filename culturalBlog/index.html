  <div class = "paragraph">So, it seems that we’ve reached the end of foundations.  It took a while but now all that’s next is actually doing the bootcamp, the idea is really intimidating, but I feel more well prepared than I thought I would.  The one thing I notice is the week to week changes, every week I can look back at a problem I couldn’t solve the week before, and be proud of the steps I took.  What has kept me going throughout this course so far are the small victories, seeing the differences and knowing I’m a bit better than I was the day before.  I hope this will the same experience in Bootcamp, but I get the sense that it will instead be a massive sense of being overwhelmed, and a dragging feeling of being the furthest behind, and that I’m slowing down other people with my lack of experience and coding ability.  That’s why I try to be as pleased as as I can over little things, even something as small as, I’ve noticed that I’m typing a lot faster then I was at the beginning of foundations.  I’ve learned a few things about myself and my ego from paying attention to my feelings throughout my work.  I’ve found that I have a tendency to put myself down far more often than is neccesary, and compare myself to others, getting annoyed that I’m at the back, or at least I am in my own imagination.  Also a very strong feeling of embarrasment, and dare I say, shame, when I can’t figure something out fast enough.  When my girlfriend looks over my shoulder and asks me more questions to lead me to an answer, I just get more and more frustrated at the idea that there is something so simple that I can not see that apprantly is plainly obvious to others.  This feelings are entirely unhelpful and only serve to slow me down.  I find that having a deeper awareness of myelf will eventually help me become a better learner and studier, as I will eventually learn what I need to do in order to help myself avoid distraction and not be mired in depression.  I wouldn’t go so far as to say that I was surprised by this revalation, I feel like I knew myself well enough to know and predict where my short comings and flaws are, I was able to see the areas I would have difficulty with coming.  That being said, this experience has given me strong motivation to look into better techniques to better motivate myself, and calm myself down if I grow too flustered.  I can only imagine how intense being an actual programmar will be, everything I’ve heard has led me to believe that in terms of stress, it will be very difficult.  So I’m thinking of incorporating meditation and daily exercise into my life, as well as a better diet, hopefully that will take some of the edge off.  So far, when it comes to core learning, I did not find it nearly as difficult as the actual coding, though I suppose when it came to journaling in my own time, I found it quite boring, and the urge to ignore it was very strong.  Apologies if that sounds rude, but really the only block for core was working up the motivation to do it, there is certainly the sense that the core is less important than the coding skills we are learning in this course.  But the core is teaching us how to be a good person to work with while attempting to keep us healthy as we get deeper into this lifestyle, so I will attempt to try much harder with core.  I’ve spent plenty of my time lately practicing code (though there is always the feeling that I should be doing more) but I feel as though core is not a waste of time, though I may not be able to see the answer so clearly, I cqan tell I am definetly better at the work than I was before, sure I was given the skills by the tech work, but I think core must have a hand in that as well.  The urge to quit and give up has been felt many times, that sense that I’m not good enough to do this, but why?  Why am I not good enough to do this, whats so different about me and all the nerds who do this for a living?  I want to be good enough to make a career from this, this is my start, and clearly EDA knows it’s stuff, so if they tell me that mastering core is the best way to help me be the best I can be, then I’ll learn all I can.  Also, one final thought, sorry I called this blog “Cultural Blog”, I know I didn’t mention culture once, their idea for a name, not mine.</div>
