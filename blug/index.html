    <div class="paragraph">Newcomers to Html and CSS never really know what to expect.  I should know, I’m one of these newcomers, I barely understand what I’m researching and every day it there’s a new challenge that I have to overcome before doing It all over again the next day.  It’s exciting being challenged, but can be discouraging at times, but this blog isn’t about that, it’s about how I make my life slightly easier.  Using proper syntax and elements is incredibly important in coding, if you do it wrong it could either cause your whole program not to work, or it could simply mean that whoever looks at your work would simply not understand.  I am not writing this blog to help anyone but myself, it’s my understanding that by explaining these properties enough times they will eventually make sense to me, so enjoy my ramblings.  So far, I have gained a basic understanding of how html and CSS work, there is so much left to learn and there is no way I could memorize all of the different elements required to make it all work, so everything I have done so far is rough with the intention of polishing soon.  For most of the work I have done, only the most basic elements have been required, things like h1, p and div have been most of what I’ve used.  But there are two others, class and Id which are very useful and do almost the exact same thing, but I’ve found that understanding the difference between the two can save a lot of headaches, as it is a common beginner pitfall to fall into, misusing the two elements.  So far, I have never used JavaScript, only having done basic decoration of websites so far but I’m told that these two elements become even more useful and common in Java, and the need for distinction much more important.  These two are both called “hooks”, h1 and p are both tags we can use to quickly identify certain elements, but there are many sections of a page that do not have a relevant tag to signify it, in this case we use one of our hooks.  By slapping one of these identifying labels onto our new section (i.e., div id=”footer”) while in html we’ll now be able to easily find it in CSS simply by typing in, .footer.  Both Id’s and classes can do this, but there is a big difference.  An ID is unique.  This means that each element can have only one ID, and each page can only have one element with that one ID.  This is very important; your code will not pass validation if multiple ID’s are used.  On the other hand, Classes are not unique, you can use the same class on multiple elements, and you may use multiple classes on the same element.  You can use as many classes as you want so you will often find yourself relying on them more often, yet ID’s convey importance and should be used on important elements.  A good analogy for these two hooks is probably a bar code and a serial number.  If you scan the bar code, it will tell the store what the item is and how much it costs, it will be able to tell what color the product is and even where it is kept in the store, each product in the store will have the same bar code.  But the product will also have a serial number on it, one that is unique to it, there will be no other product with that number in the world, but that serial number could not store the price information, it wouldn’t be a very efficient way to store that information.  ID’s and classes are like this, reusable information should be kept in a class while unique information should be kept in an ID.  </div>
