    <div class="title">Cam Thoughts...</div> 
    <div class="paragraph-1"> People often ask me, Cam, do you have thoughts?  If yes then what are those thoughts?  Will you tell us them?  Is there a website we can go to where we can read your thoughts?</div>
    <div class="paragraph-2"> To those people I would say, no.  There is no website where you can go to to read my thoughts, unless the goverment has finished that technology.  So I thought that I would create a website that would allow others to read thoughts that I have consented to put on the internet.  Yes, these people exist so here we are. </div>
