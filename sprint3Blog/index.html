    <div class="paragraph">Alright, time for another blog, this one will cover the tech that I explored through this sprint, to the best of my memory.  If I were to compare HTML and CSS to each other, I would probably say that HTML is like Wikipedia, and CSS is like Pinterest.  HTML is just pure information detailed, in order and organized to be understood easily, it’s full of links yet it’s kinda bland.  Pinterest on the other hand is light on words and organization and is all about the pictures and design, it doesn’t matter where you write what you’re trying to do, just write it and It’ll come together, so long as you name it correctly, it exists for the art, so it feels so much more free-form than HTML, yet it is lacking in information and function, you cant learn anything from Pinterest, it’s a workspace for artists.  Yet if you look at Wikipedia, though each entry is written by a stranger who thinks they know what they’re talking about, it still has information present which can be useful.  That’s not the best example but I’m not writing this blog to express my proficiency with analogies.  Either way, HTML, CSS, old news.  We’ve got to talk about JavaScript.  The third system I’ve looked at, and it makes the least sense by far.  JavaScript is the tool used to create functions in a website, the simplest example of something you could create in JS would be a button.  May seem simple but there’s a lot that goes into it.  You first need to create the button in HTML, decide how it looks and where it’s placed with CSS, then you need to actually make it work with JS.  By creating an ‘event finder’ you can tell JS what it should be looking out for, i.e., someone clicking the button, then depending on what you want the button to do, you need to determine it’s function.  Like recording the amount of times the button has been clicked, changing the button’s color on each press, or adding a toggle function, i.e.; on and off.  For someone inexperienced like me, this feels quite difficult, because everything must be done in the correct order, or flow.  Imagine making a piece of toast, you don’t spread your jam on the plate and then slap down a piece of toasted bread into the raspberry pile you’ve created to start your day, no, you put jam on toast, JS is like this.  You need a proper flow, and the exact right syntax or else you’ll be bombarded with error messages.  From what I’ve learned so far, there is a lot of trial and error that goes into this work, because there are many different kinds of solutions to problems, but many of them won’t work, if you’re up against the wall, keep trying until a solution sticks, and your function begins to work.  This is why I like the DOM and the dev tools.  DOM stands for Dominant Object Model, you can access it by inspecting you browser, it gives you an in-depth look at the HTML, CSS, and JS of whatever site you are looking at, this is useful for so many different reasons, not least of all is the ability to copy someone else’s work.  But by creating a workspace in your browser, you can use it as a code editor, this is handy as it cuts out the middle man, allowing you to see the changes in your file even faster than with vs code, though vs can be a bit more user friendly.  In the last task I needed to finish the code in JS for a game board, it looked like a board for tic-tac-toe.  I had to make sure the buttons changed color, and that the color changes were recorded and numerically presented on screen.  Sounds simple enough, but I think I struggled with this task more than any previous one, I tried every which way to get the colors to actually be counted, but I didn’t know the exact way to write the function I wanted, so I searched for a long time trying to find the answer.  Of course the answer was right in front of my face the entire time, but this issue really stressed me out, got me grumpy and kept me up at night.  In the morning I looked at it with fresh eyes and fixed it pretty quickly.  I have to remember to step back every once in a while.  I need to do much more work on JS before I can feel like I grasp it, will tackle the work more and more until it gets easier, but for now, live with the headache.</div>
